# This docker-compose file is an example for a setup with a single API Gateway container and a single Elasticsearch container.
# The image name of API Gateway can be set by modifying the .env file when the file is in the working directory or by setting the environment variable APIGW_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME.
# To use this file run: docker-compose -f apigw-elasticsearch-no-cluster.yml up
# Append -d to run it in detached mode.
# To stop and remove containers, networks, volumes and images created by up run: docker-compose -f apigw-elasticsearch-no-cluster.yml down
